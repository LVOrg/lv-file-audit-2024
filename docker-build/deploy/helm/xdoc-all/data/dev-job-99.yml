# Thou! please carefully reading to avoid mistake !!!!!
# This Helm values declare all you need to deploy LV-File-Service to Developer environment, On Premise infrastructure or AWS

# All pods in this deployment require below info (regardless where they would be installed):
#  Tất cả các Pod trong quá trình triển khai này đều yêu cầu thông tin bên dưới (bất kể chúng sẽ được cài đặt ở đâu):

# 1 - MongodDb database, embody by tuples of :  host, authSource, username, password. My Lambkin! do not worry about each infor that. The explanation will be show each line in this Helm Values.
# 2- Need one database in MongoDb to manage all Tenants even if File-Service just sevrve for only one Tenant. (Cần một cơ sở dữ liệu trong MongoDb để quản lý tất cả các Đối tượng thuê ngay cả khi Dịch vụ tệp chỉ phục vụ cho một Đối tượng thuê.)
# 3- At Least one ElasticSearch in which embody in tuples of: server and prefix_index ('prefix_index will be explained when it was declare')
# 4- One broker message. When Pod wanna to inform to others. The Pod could not directly  inform. It just informs to broker message and broker message will inform to another.
# 5- One temporary storage
