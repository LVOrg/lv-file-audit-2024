# Thou! please carefully reading to avoid mistake !!!!!
# This Helm values declare all you need to deploy LV-File-Service to Developer environment, On Premise infrastructure or AWS

# All pods in this deployment require below info (regardless where they would be installed):
#  Tất cả các Pod trong quá trình triển khai này đều yêu cầu thông tin bên dưới (bất kể chúng sẽ được cài đặt ở đâu):

# 1 - MongodDb database, embody by tuples of :  host, authSource, username, password. My Lambkin! do not worry about each infor that. The explanation will be show each line in this Helm Values.
# 2- Need one database in MongoDb to manage all Tenants even if File-Service just sevrve for only one Tenant. (Cần một cơ sở dữ liệu trong MongoDb để quản lý tất cả các Đối tượng thuê ngay cả khi Dịch vụ tệp chỉ phục vụ cho một Đối tượng thuê.)
# 3- At Least one ElasticSearch in which embody in tuples of: server and prefix_index ('prefix_index will be explained when it was declare')
# 4- One broker message. When Pod wanna to inform to others. The Pod could not directly  inform. It just informs to broker message and broker message will inform to another.
# 5- One temporary storage

    # File-Service need one database in a certain Mongodb to manage all Tenants.
    # 'admin_db_name' is a crucial database.
    # Wrong 'admin_db_value' will cause chain of crash.
    # When File-Service or File-API start,
    # it will detect if 'admin-db-name' in a certain Mongodb is existing.
    # if 'admin_db_name' was not found File-Service or File-API will automatically create new database
    # name by value of 'admin_db_name' in a certain MongoDB. So,
    #wrong value of admin_db_name that mean new system was created.
    #This is required value even if File-Server or File-API just serve for only one Tenant.
    authSource: 'admin'
    # As usual, when File-API or File-Service work with MongodDB.
    # MongoDB will accquire valid authentication.
    # Validation MongoDB authentication need a tuple of authSource, host, username and password
    host: '172.16.0.83'
    # host to MongoDB or Mongos Routes.
    # For Mongos Router the host is a list of server name or IP separated by coma

  # clarification of ElasticSearch
    prefix_index: 'qtsc-codx'
    # File-Service and File-API need a certain ElasticSearch
    # where readable content of File Upload was index in.
    # Index-ElasticSearch and MongoDB Tenant Database is corresponding to Managed-Tenants.
    # For ElasticSearch do not have something call Database.
    # ElasticSearch use Index-Name lieu of Database.
    # When API-File and File-Service create new Tenant they also create new ElasticSearch
    # Index by concat 'prefix_index' and Tenant-Name.
    # Example Tenant-Name is qc, ElasticSearch Index Name is lv-codx_qc
    server: 'http://172.16.0.83:9200'
    # In poor conditional, we have only one ElasticServer Node
    # if thee's system need more than one node this value will be a list of url separated by comma
